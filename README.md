# AlphaZero-version AI Program in the Game of Renju(Gomoku)

Introduction
====
Google DeepMind's recent AlphaZero algorithm, accepting no domain-specific knowledges, mastered the game of Go, chess and shogi through self-played reinforcement learning from scratch, showing the potential of general AI, which is the holy grail of the entire AI community. In this project, we implement an AlphaZero-version Renju(Gomoku) AI program and provide a step-by-step tutorial on the technique.

We would like to say thanks to BaiAn Chen from MIT and MingWen Liu from Gradient Trading for their generous help throughout the research. We are also grateful to ZhiPeng Liang and Hao Chen from Sun Yat-sen University for their supports of the training process of our Gomoku AI. Without their supports, it's hard for us to finish such a complicated task.
